# GitHub Project Read-Me

## Project Description

This web project demonstrates my skills in working with SCSS, responsive design, and the integration of dynamic elements. The project includes various functional features such as a hamburger menu for mobile devices, card animations, and integration with Google Maps.

### Key Features:

- **Hamburger menu** for mobile devices.
- **Card animations** in the "Our talents" section on the homepage.
- Animations in the **portfolio** section.
- **Price card enlargement** in the "Services" section on hover.
- In the **Contact** section, the map enlarges on hover, and clicking redirects to Google Maps with the exact address.

### Technologies:

- **SCSS** for styling.
- **HTML5**, **CSS3**.
- Responsiveness using **media queries**.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic elements (e.g., hamburger menu, animations).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Open the project files in your browser:
   Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website in action.

4. For local development (if SCSS is used):
   Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   To compile SCSS to CSS:
   ```bash
   npm run sass
   ```

5. For testing and validation, use:
   - HTML/CSS validation via [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
   - Check responsiveness using the browser's built-in developer tools.

## Tasks Completed in the Project

1. Completed the layout of all template components according to the design.
2. Ensured responsiveness across all pages for proper display on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
3. Used SCSS for clean and organized code, applying variables, mixins, and nesting.
4. Implemented dynamic elements integration:
   - Hamburger menu.
   - Card animations.
   - Interactive map with Google Maps integration.
   
5. Conducted cross-browser and responsiveness testing.
